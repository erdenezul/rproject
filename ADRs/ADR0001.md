## Context

Wanted to document the decision for chosen techstack why I chose certain technologies to aid further discussion during interview: 

## Option Analysis

### Option 1: Work with famililar technology

1. Prisma as a Database Layer
2. NestJS as a Back-end technology


### Option 2: Work with current company's techstack

1. BunJS as a back-end technology
2. Database Layer is unknown from the job description

### Summary of assessment

| key | option1 | option2 | 
| --- | ------- | ------- |
| learning curve | Already familiar with the technology | Unknown territory for me at the moment  |
| 
| pros | won't waste time reading documentation | might have to read documents how to design API and so on |
| cons | Tech stack is different from Job description | Interviewee reviews code in familiar territory | 

## Decision

For given time constraint (5 hours) and accounting learning curve to save time and focus on main Data schema problem, it would much make sense I go for `option #1`
